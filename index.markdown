<p>  My research focuses on explaining modern Machine Learning models.
	   The notion of explainability has become central in Machine Learning since
	   large-scale deployment of Machine Learning models requires trust,
	   which relies heavily on the ability of human beings to understand
	   the predictions of such models.</p>
