	 I am a PhD student in <em>Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) </em>
	 in the Department of Applied Mathematics and Theoretical Physics at
	 the <em>University of Cambridge</em>. </p>
  <p>My work aims to develop new interpretability methods for Machine Learning models.
	   The notion of interpretability has become central in Machine Learning since
	   large-scale deployment of Machine Learning models requires trust,
	   which relies heavily on the ability of human beings to understand
	   the predictions of such models.</p>
