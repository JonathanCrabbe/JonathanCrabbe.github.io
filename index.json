If labelling the data is a typical solution, it is often costly and time-consuming. Models such as neural networks typically require thousands to millions of examples to solve a task. Is it possible to learn good representations of the data without having to label each one of these examples?\nRepresentation Learning provides interesting solutions through semi-supervised and self-supervised learning. With these techniques, it becomes increasingly realistic to solve complex tasks with few labelled examples. In some cases, we might want these representations to be understandable by human users.

If generalization to unseen data is undoubtedly necessary, it is rarely sufficient. Models such as neural networks typically involve millions of operations to turn their input data into a prediction. This complexity permits to solve hard problems like computer vision and protein structure prediction. However, these complex models tend to exhibit unpredictable behaviours, such as the sensitivity to adversarial perturbations and spurious correlations . When models penetrate critical areas such as medicine, finance and the criminal justice system, this unpredictability is highly problematic.\nRobust machine learning tackles this problem by providing tools to identify and fix the weaknesses of a model. This includes (but is not limited to) understanding the model’s failure modes, quantifying the model’s uncertainty and teaching a model to be robust with respect to noise/adversarial perturbations.

If accuracy is undoubtedly necessary, it is rarely sufficient. Models such as neural networks typically involve millions of operations to turn their input data into a prediction. This complexity permits to accurately solve hard problems like computer vision and protein structure prediction. However, this accuracy comes at the expense of interpretability: these complex models appear as black boxes for human users. When models penetrate critical areas such as medicine, finance and the criminal justice system, their black-box nature appears as a major issue. An important question follows: is it possible to explain the predictions of complex machine-learning models?\nExplainable AI tackles this question by providing an interface between complex models and human users. To illustrate, let us consider the example of a medical machine learning model that recommends a treatment for a patient. By using post-hoc explainability, we can answer crucial questions such as “What part of this patient’s data motivates the model’s recommendation?” or “Are there similar patients previously seen by the model for which this treatment worked?”. In a setting where human knowledge is available (e.g. computer vision), this type of information is crucial to validate/debug the model. In a setting where little human knowledge (e.g. scientific discovery), this type of information permits to extract knowledge from the model.\n","date":1598918400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1598918400,"objectID":"07f8e974c92fc49679f5a434ce1d7cbe","permalink":"https://jonathancrabbe.github.io/project/xai/","publishdate":"2020-09-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/xai/","section":"project","summary":"Creating an interface between machine learning models and human beings.","tags":["Machine learning","Deep learning","Transparency","Explainability","Interpretability"],"title":"Explainable Artificial Intelligence","type":"project"},{"authors":[],"categories":[],"content":"Create slides in Markdown with Wowchemy Wowchemy | Documentation\nFeatures Efficiently write slides in Markdown 3-in-1: Create, Present, and Publish your slides Supports speaker notes Mobile friendly slides Controls Next: Right Arrow or Space Previous: Left Arrow Start: Home Finish: End Overview: Esc Speaker notes: S Fullscreen: F Zoom: Alt + Click PDF Export Code Highlighting Inline code: variable\nCode block:\nporridge = \u0026#34;blueberry\u0026#34; if porridge == \u0026#34;blueberry\u0026#34;: print(\u0026#34;Eating...\u0026#34;) Math In-line math: $x + y = z$\nBlock math:\n$$ f\\left( x \\right) = ;\\frac{{2\\left( {x + 4} \\right)\\left( {x - 4} \\right)}}{{\\left( {x + 4} \\right)\\left( {x + 1} \\right)}} $$\nFragments Make content appear incrementally\n{{% fragment %}} One {{% /fragment %}} {{% fragment %}} **Two** {{% /fragment %}} {{% fragment %}} Three {{% /fragment %}} Press Space to play!\nOne Two Three A fragment can accept two optional parameters:\nclass: use a custom style (requires definition in custom CSS) weight: sets the order in which a fragment appears Speaker Notes Add speaker notes to your presentation\n{{% speaker_note %}} - Only the speaker can read these notes - Press `S` key to view {{% /speaker_note %}} Press the S key to view the speaker notes!\nOnly the speaker can read these notes Press S key to view Themes black: Black background, white text, blue links (default) white: White background, black text, blue links league: Gray background, white text, blue links beige: Beige background, dark text, brown links sky: Blue background, thin dark text, blue links night: Black background, thick white text, orange links serif: Cappuccino background, gray text, brown links simple: White background, black text, blue links solarized: Cream-colored background, dark green text, blue links Custom Slide Customize the slide style and background\n{{\u0026lt; slide background-image=\u0026#34;/media/boards.jpg\u0026#34; \u0026gt;}} {{\u0026lt; slide background-color=\u0026#34;#0000FF\u0026#34; \u0026gt;}} {{\u0026lt; slide class=\u0026#34;my-style\u0026#34; \u0026gt;}} Custom CSS Example Let’s make headers navy colored.\nCreate assets/css/reveal_custom.css with:\n.reveal section h1, .reveal section h2, .reveal section h3 { color: navy; } Questions?
